✅ The dataset used in this project is the Diamonds Dataset by ULRIK THYGE PEDERSEN. 

✅ It contains 53940 entries of diamonds and their physical charecteristics with price.

✅ Analyse relations between physical charecteristics and price

Building application using intel oneDAL:The Intel oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) contributes to the acceleration of big data analysis by providing highly optimised algorithmic building blocks for all phases of data analytics (preprocessing, transformation, analysis, modelling, validation, and decision making) in batch, online, and distributed processing modes of computation.The library optimizes data ingestion along with algorithmic computation to increase throughput and scalability.

✅ The result is as shown
